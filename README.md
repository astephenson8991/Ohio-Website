# Ohio-Website
Description
This repository contains the code for the "Ohio Website," a project I developed as part of my coursework. The goal of this project was to build a simple multi-page website providing information about the state of Ohio and some of its major cities (Columbus, Cleveland, and Toledo). It served as a practical exercise to apply fundamental web development concepts learned in class.

Features
The Ohio Website includes the following features:

Multi-page Structure: Separate HTML pages for the home page and dedicated pages for Columbus, Cleveland, and Toledo.

Navigation: A persistent navigation bar to easily move between the different pages.

City Information: Pages dedicated to specific cities, including basic facts and data (like population and income).

External Links: Sidebars on each page providing links to official city/state websites, maps, and famous residents.

Modern Styling with Tailwind CSS: Utilized the Tailwind CSS framework to enhance the visual design and implement responsive layout.

Simple Form with Validation: A contact/signup form on the home page with basic client-side validation using JavaScript to ensure email fields match and are not empty.

Lessons Learned
Developing this website was a valuable learning experience that helped solidify my understanding of core web development technologies and practices. Some of the key lessons I learned include:

HTML Structure and Semantics: Gained a deeper understanding of structuring web content using HTML elements, including headers, navigation, sections, asides, forms, tables, and footers.

Using a CSS Framework (Tailwind CSS): Experienced the benefits of using a utility-first CSS framework like Tailwind to rapidly style elements and build responsive layouts with pre-defined classes. This was a significant step up in understanding modern CSS workflows.

Responsive Web Design: Applied techniques (particularly with Tailwind's responsive utilities) to make the website's layout adapt and look good on various screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.

Client-Side JavaScript: Implemented basic JavaScript for form validation, learning how to select DOM elements, handle events (like form submission), access input values, and provide user feedback.

Linking Resources: Practiced linking external CSS stylesheets and JavaScript files to HTML documents.

File Organization: Learned how to structure project files and folders logically (HTML files, CSS, JS, images).

Creating a Multi-Page Site: Understood the process of building a website with multiple interconnected pages using navigation links.

Working with External Libraries/CDNs: Used a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to easily include the Tailwind CSS framework in the project.

This project provided a practical foundation in front-end web development and the experience of building a complete, albeit simple, website from scratch.
